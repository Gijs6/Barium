# Barium

![The Barium logo](logo.png)

A simple static site generator.  
Jekyll is undocumented, and Flask feels a bit too bulky when all you need is a simple static site, so Barium aims to be the best of both worlds.

Barium generates static HTML pages from Markdown files and Jinja templates. And that's it. You get a folder of clean, static files and you can host them however and wherever you like. After all, it's a static site generator, not a static site deployer.

It also includes a really simple HTTP server to help you preview your site during development please don't use it in production.
